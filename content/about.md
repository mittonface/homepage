## Hi, I'm Brent.

I'm a programmer/developer/computer dude from Prince Edward Island. Like most other programmers, I have an interest
in solving complicated problems in interesting ways that don't suck.

If you want to learn more about my experience, check out my resume. If you want to learn more about me, check out my social media (pardon the memes).
